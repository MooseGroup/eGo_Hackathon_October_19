# Hackathon by e.GO Digital Team Moose ðŸ¦Œ

## Obective
The task given was to enhance the e.GO Digital e.Base platform with following objectives:

* Increase usage of station based car sharing in e.Base supporting settlements
* Decrease output of CO2 
* Motivate users by gratifiying good behavior

## Pitch
Our vision is that people in an e.Base supported settelment could post public car sharing bookings, e.g. dropping of kids at the nearby school or going to a concert in town. This way others can join for the ride and split the cost of the ride itself and also help decreasing CO2 by more efficient commute compared to cars with free seats. 
In addition to that local venues and activities will be publicly visible this way and give inspiration. By increasing carpooling in a local community we might also be able to increase the social network in such a settelment.

## Context
Our idea positions itself as a new type of booking in e.Base platform that is public.
So it needs to be considered that our UI/UX starts asuming that the user is fully aware that all entered information will be public. 
For reduced complexity we also left out infrastructure like payments and user profiles even though such commodities would be needed for an actual launchable product.
